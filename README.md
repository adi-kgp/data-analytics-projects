This repository contains all the data analytics projects that I learnt recently (from Feb, 2024 onwards) from youtube channels. 

The philosophy was to code along and experiment with the code by tweaking parameters, trying out different datasets, using some new 

functions or to just learn whatever is been taught by the instructor on their youtube channels. 

This exercise ultimately aims to provide a proof-of-practice and knowledge-of-analytics-concepts to potential recruiters to whom I 
intend to show this repository and explain the code in detail.
